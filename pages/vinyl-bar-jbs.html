        <h2>Quick answer: Is JBS a must-visit?</h2>
        <p>For vinyl enthusiasts, yes. It is arguably the most visually striking listening bar in Tokyo due to the sheer volume of records. However, it is a one-man operation, so patience and respect for the owner's space are essential.</p>

        <h2>The Collection and the Man</h2>
        <p>JBS stands for Jazz, Blues, and Soul. The owner, Kobayashi-san, is a fixture of the Tokyo music scene. He runs the bar entirely by himself. The walls are covered floor-to-ceiling with records, organized in a way only he understands. It looks like a library, and in many ways, it is one.</p>
        <p>Kobayashi-san is constantly pulling records, cleaning them, and cueing them up. His flow is hypnotic to watch. The music ranges from hard bop and spiritual jazz to rare soul and funk. It is a place where you might hear the original sample for a famous hip-hop track, followed by a blues standard.</p>

        <h2>Atmosphere and Vibe</h2>
        <p>The space is small and can get crowded, especially since it has become quite famous on social media. Despite the fame, the vibe remains relatively chill. It's a place to sit, drink, and listen. It’s not a party bar.</p>
        <p>During the day, the light filters in, illuminating the spines of thousands of records. At night, it feels cozy and enclosed. It's an excellent spot for a midday break from the chaos of Shibuya or an early evening warm-up.</p>

        <h2>What to Drink</h2>
        <p>The menu is simple: beer, highballs, coffee, and tea. Don't expect fancy mixology here. You come here for the music and the atmosphere, not a 12-ingredient cocktail. The prices are reasonable, and there is usually a small cover charge.</p>

        <h2>Visitor Tips</h2>
        <p>Because it is a one-man show, service can be slow if it's busy. Be patient. Don't crowd the counter if you aren't seated there. And while photos are generally allowed (unlike Bar Martha), be respectful. Don't use flash, and don't treat the owner like a zoo exhibit. He is working.</p>

          <h2>FAQ: JBS</h2>
          <h3>When is the best time to go?</h3>
          <p>Afternoons on weekdays are often quieter. Weekends can see a line or a full house.</p>
          <h3>Does he take requests?</h3>
          <p>No. Kobayashi-san plays what he wants. Trust his taste; it's impeccable.</p>
          <h3>Is there food?</h3>
          <p>Very limited snacks. Eat before you come.</p>
