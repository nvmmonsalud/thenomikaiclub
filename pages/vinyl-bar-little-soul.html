        <h2>Quick answer: Why visit Little Soul Cafe?</h2>
        <p>It’s the antithesis of the "strict audiophile bar." Little Soul Cafe is fun, chatty, and unpretentious. If you want to listen to great music without worrying about breaking a rule, this is your spot.</p>

        <h2>The Vibe</h2>
        <p>Located on the second floor in the heart of Shimokitazawa, the bar is intimate and dimly lit with warm, amber hues. The walls are lined with records, but the atmosphere is loose. You can talk, laugh, and enjoy yourself. It perfectly matches the bohemian, laid-back energy of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>The music is strictly soul, funk, jazz-funk, and disco. The volume is perfect—loud enough to groove to, but low enough to hold a conversation. The selection is deep, often featuring rare 7-inch singles that will have you asking the bartender, "What is this track?"</p>

        <h2>Drinks</h2>
        <p>Little Soul Cafe is known for its rum selection, but they have a full bar. The cocktails are tasty and unpretentious. They also have a good selection of beer and whisky. It’s a great place to settle in for a few rounds.</p>

        <h2>The Neighborhood</h2>
        <p>Shimokitazawa is Tokyo's vintage clothing and theater district. Little Soul Cafe fits right in. It’s a great place to end a day of thrift shopping or after seeing a show. The crowd is a mix of locals, musicians, and visitors who found the spot through word-of-mouth.</p>
