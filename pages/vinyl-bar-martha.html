        <h2>Quick answer: Is Bar Martha worth the rules?</h2>
        <p>Absolutely. If you are willing to abide by the "no photos, no loud talking" rule, Bar Martha offers one of the most immersive sonic experiences in Tokyo. It is not a place to catch up with friends over loud drinks; it is a place to commune with the music.</p>

        <h2>Why Bar Martha is legendary</h2>
        <p>Located in Ebisu, Bar Martha is often described as a modern "jazz kissa" but with a broader musical palette. The space is dominated by massive wooden Tannoy speakers that fill the room with warm, detailed sound. The walls are lined with thousands of records, ranging from classic rock and blues to jazz and soul.</p>
        <p>The "no photos" policy is strictly enforced to preserve the atmosphere. This isn't about being pretentious; it's about ensuring that everyone in the room is present and focused on the auditory experience. The result is a uniquely focused vibe where the crackle of the needle and the depth of the bass are the main attractions.</p>

        <h2>The Listening Experience</h2>
        <p>The sound system at Bar Martha is tuned for clarity and warmth. You won't just hear the music; you'll feel the texture of the instruments. The volume is loud enough to be immersive but not ear-splittingly painful. It's the kind of sound that invites you to close your eyes and drift away.</p>
        <p>Selections are made by the staff and are generally album sides or carefully curated sequences. You might hear a full side of Led Zeppelin followed by a deep cut of Miles Davis. The eclectic mix is part of the charm, as you never quite know what will come next, but you can trust it will sound incredible.</p>

        <h2>Drinks and Food</h2>
        <p>While the music is the star, the bar doesn't slouch on drinks. They serve excellent highballs, cold beer, and a solid selection of whisky. The food menu is surprisingly robust for a listening bar, featuring comfort dishes that pair well with the drinking and listening experience.</p>

        <h2>Service and Etiquette</h2>
        <p>As mentioned, the rules are key here. Keep your voice down. Do not take photos. If you are chatting too loudly, you will be politely (or sometimes sternly) shushed. This is a sanctuary for sound, and the staff takes their role as guardians of that sanctuary seriously.</p>
        <p>There is a cover charge, which is standard for high-end listening bars in Tokyo. It's a small price to pay for the quality of the system and the curation.</p>

          <h2>FAQ: Bar Martha</h2>
          <h3>Can I make a request?</h3>
          <p>Generally, no. The playlist is curated by the staff. Sit back and trust their selection.</p>
          <h3>Is it good for groups?</h3>
          <p>Not really. It is best for solo listeners or couples who are comfortable sitting in silence or speaking in hushed tones. Large groups will likely be turned away or split up.</p>
          <h3>What happens if I take a photo?</h3>
          <p>You will be asked to stop immediately. Continued violation will lead to being asked to leave. Respect the vibe.</p>
